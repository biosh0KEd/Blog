This is were plan to store my blog articles.

I don't know if it will be a problem if I try to put images in the markdown files, because I plan to use the GitHub API to get the files and present them in my portafolio as HTML content.

I'll try to take that aproach and see how it works.

---
I will also make two different files but with the same content one in Spanish and the other in English, maybe in German too but my German is not that good yet.

I don't know if that the best way to do it, but we will see.
