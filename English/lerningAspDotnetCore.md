# My experience learning ASP.NET Core
I was working on some proyects in blazor and I really liked it, it is really easy to use, because you use C# both in the Frontend and in the Backend and it comunicates with JavaScript in a really simple way, allowing you to call JS functions from C# an viseversa.

I was using DevExpress UI library, because my company used it, and it was pretty nice, but it is not as complete as, for example, WPF library, and that is an important thing because we plan to make a very big system. So I was forced to change to ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.

## From Blazor to ASP.NET Core
What I have experienced by now is that Blazor clearly feels as an evolution of ASP.NET Core, the razor pages .cshtml, are like the father of the .razor pages.

And the arquitecture is completly diferent, here in ASP is more marked the difference between the server and the client parts, wereas in blazor it is less defined.
