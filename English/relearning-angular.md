# Relearning Angular

A few year ago I learn angular via a course, it was great, that is how I created my project GoGDL.
Buy now I have forgot almost everything I learn, of course once I see the code again it will be easier to understand it, but that feels terrible.

So right now I wanted to make a project to relearn Angular an to gain experience in the software industry. Rith now I don't know if the best path to take is to take another course or to start building it and find things out on the way.

So I will try a little of both things and I will see what happen.
