# Making my Developer Portfolio
This will be the first thing I write about on my blog, making this portfolio is something I was planning to make for a long time, but I didn't make the time to do it until now.

I plan to keep making more articles of anything I learn at my job or in my free time.

## Blazor WASM
I decided to use Blazor because it is what I currently use at work, and the Web Assembly version because I have no need for a backend in my portfolio.

## Blazorise
I use the library Blazorise because I thought it had cool stuff, but I think everything I used from that library was possible using bootstrap classes, but I hope to use it more in the future.
