# Making my Dev Portfolio
This will be the first thing I write about on my blog, making this portfolio is something I was planning to make for a long time, but I didn't make the time to do it until now.

I plan to keep making more articles of anything I learn at my job or in my free time.

## Blazor WASM
I decided to use Blazor because it is what I currently use at work, and the Web Assembly version because I had no need for a backend.

Or at least that is what I was thought, witch was maybe incorrect because of what I will mention in the Blog section.

## Blazorise
I use the library Blazorise because I thought it had cool stuff, but I think everything I used from that library was possible using bootstrap classes, but I hope to use it more in the future.

## Blog
To make the blog secction I decided to use Markdown documents per post, I believe this is a really easy aproach and I made it like that in order not to discorage myself from publishing blog posts.

It was really easy to I just use a Nuget package called **Markdig**.

I was planing on using the **GitHub API** to retrive the documents but I am not sure if I will expose my API key so I haven't done that yet, I currently have the Markdown documents in the project folder but I belive that will make my app slower.
